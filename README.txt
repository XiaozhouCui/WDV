Website overview:
SafeTec Pacific website is built as an online Learning Management System, supporting our offline courses provided in company's office. 
Anyone who are interested in the courses can register and apply  online. Once the prospective students are enrolled by admin, they can interact with the company and their trainers on the website through the Learning Management System.
The Learning Management System can handle the information of courses, classes, students, trainers and training materials. For example, any visitor can register their interest and became a prospective student. Once the prospective student is enrolled into a class by the admin, he or she then becomes a current student. A trainer can upload training materials. A current student can check the status of his/her class, browse training materials, check class notice board, and join the online discussion with trainers and fellow students.
